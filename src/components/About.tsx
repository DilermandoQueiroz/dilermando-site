                ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Dilermando Queiroz Neto from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Iâ€™m pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo, working on the <a href="https://fairmi.site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">FairMI project</a>.
                My research focuses on developing methods to detect and remove bias in healthcare Foundation Models (FMs), especially for medical imaging. This work is crucial since biased AI can undermine equitable healthcare delivery for underrepresented communities.
